There’s an interesting thing about this pattern. It surely looks different because there are spaces before
stars but other than that its same as the previous pattern. She didn’t believe me and also she didn’t have
any idea of how to do it. Things to notice in this pattern: 1. No. of lines 2. No of triangles 3. Is the no. of
stars increasing or decreasing per line and by how much? Now what are these triangles? You see there
are 2 triangles in this pattern. One made my the spaces and another made by the stars
